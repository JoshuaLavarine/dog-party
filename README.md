# Dog Party

Itâ€™s a dog party! This is my first project on my path towards becoming a frontend developer. The project involved turning a 1-page static comp into a 1-page static site. 

# Goals 

- Creating well structured, semantic HTML
- Creating clean, precise, and D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") CSS
- Adding JavaScript and media queries to make the page more accessible and interactive

# Motivation

This is the first project that my instructors will be able to critique. I want to build a site that impresses them and proves that I have what it takes to progress. 

# Built with

- Sublime
- DevTools on Google Chrome Canary

# Languages Built in 

- HTML
- CSS

# Screen Grab of Static Comp

# Screen Grab of the Static Site Created

# Shortcomings

I was unable to create an interactive and responsive site. I am a bit disappointed, but I will update this project as soon as I learn how to do it properly. I suspect that my attempted media query, which encompassed the entire body, is the reason why I could not make the media query perform as I intended. I believe that a single column page is the ultimate goal. 

# Learning during production

My code was very clean and D.R.Y. when I first started. I wanted to keep it that way throughout the project. However, the code soon became messy and full of excess information. This made the code unwieldy and hard to manage. I partnered with an older student to learn how to best scale down my code. He very helpfully made time for me and assisted with the code. Through this pairing, I learned that messy code can grow and multiply as a result of having to tweak things constantly. By cleaning and pruning the code, it becomes much clearer and more manageable. I will keep my code clean from the beginning next time!
